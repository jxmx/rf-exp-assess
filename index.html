            <p>Amateur Radio is basically a safe activity. In recent years, however, there has been considerable discussion and concern about the possible hazards of electromagnetic radiation, including both RF energy and power-frequency (50-60 Hz) electromagnetic fields.  To allay such concerns, the FCC set limits on the amount of RF energy people can be exposed to. Starting on May 3, 2021 all amateur radio stations need to be evaluated to see if they are in compliance with the rules.</p>
            <p>To determine and document compliance of your amateur radio station(s), this site will walk you through the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Radio Output Power</li>
                <li>Power into the antenna</li>
                <li>Antenna gain</li>
                <li>Completion of the OET calculations to determine exposure</li>
            </ul>
